**Climate Change Introduction**

Climate change has been a consistently pertinent topic in the 21st century.
Policies, laws, acts, and movements have all come under light due to the
impending consequences of climate change. Likewise, the same efforts can be
seen by those who don't believe in climate change.

**Domain - Annual CO2 Emissions From Fossil Fuels (By Continent)**

Data is an essential piece to make sense of the noise surrounding climate
change. It can make objective points about our current situation, but on the
other hand it can emphasize biases. This application is my try at analyzing
a small snippet of factors affecting climate change. Specifically, analyzing
annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels by continent to give us an understanding
of how climate change has "changed" for us as a whole. Additionally,
comparing this data to cumulative world data. After all, it is an
issue for the world, not just each country individually. Fossil fuels were 
chosen in specific to bring attention to how much or how little just one 
pollution source can produce. An important note, Antarctica is excluded due to
its insignificant emissions figures compared to more populated continents.

**Summary Analysis**

I analyzed these 5 values from the data set:

1. Continent with the highest fossil fuel CO2 emissions total from 1980-2020 (with value):
Asia, 2019, 20608592701
2. Continent with the lowest fossil fuel CO2 emissions total from 1980-2020 (with value):
Australia, 1980, 220537329
3. Year with the highest fossil fuel CO2 emissions total from 1980-2020 using 'World' data (with value):
World, 2019, 36702502903
4. Continent with the most CO2 emissions increase from 1980-2020 with their average annual change:
Asia, Total = +15916153596, Avg = +397903840
5. Returns data of the continent with the least CO2 emissions increase from 1980-2020 with their average annual change:
Europe, Total = -2789666941, Avg = -69741674

Conclusions that can be made from my initial analysis is that from 1980-2020, Asia is consistently
the highest fossil fuel polluter. They hold the highest fossil fuel CO2 emissions total in 2019 as 
well as the highest total and average change from 1980-2020. In contrast, both Australia and Europe have promising figures.
Australia holds the lowest fossil fuel CO2 emissions total in 1980 and Europe has actually reduced
their emissions in both total and average from 1980-2020. Additionally, looking at
the highest World total in 2019, Asia makes up a significant portion of those emissions.
This gives us a general idea of how the different continents are performing relative to each other.

The graph shows each continent's annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels compared
to the world cumulative total that year. This provides a visualization to better
understand how continents are performing relative to the total. For example, paired
alongside the initial analysis, we can see that Asia, again, makes up a large portion 
of the world data in most years. Additionally, Australia has some of the lowest figures.
By comparing each continent's bar side by side (alongside being able to click to receive
specific values), it provides a more objective way to analyze relativity in emissions. However, 
this should be used as a base understanding to conduct additional research, like finding out 
what specific events may have led to each emission total.
